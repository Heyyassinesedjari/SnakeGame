# Snake Game
This is my first Java project. <br/>
It's a simple snake game using Abstract Window Toolkit (awt) and Java Swing to display it.<br/>
I did this project first, to discover java and eclipse IDE and second, because I always wanted to see how simple games were made behind the scenes.<br/>

## Requirements:
* Java runtime installed

### How to play the game:

* Just download the SnakeGame.jar file
* Run it 
* Start playing with the arrows keys.
* If the snake's head collides with his own body or with one of the 4 borders you lose. 
* Then, just close it and re-open it (I will add a restart button possibly).
