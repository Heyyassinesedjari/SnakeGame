# Snake Game
This is my First Java Project. <br/>
It's a simple snake game using Abstract Window Toolkit (awt) and Java Swing to display it.
I did this project first, to discover java and eclipse IDE and second, because I always wanted to see how simple games were made behind the scenes.

## Requirements:
* Java runtime installed

### How to play the game:

* Just download the SnakeGame.jar file
* Run it 
* Start playing with the arrows keys. 
* If you lose, just close it and re-open it (I will add a restart button possibly)
